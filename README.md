# Moody-HW5: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This app allows users to add tasks to timeslots throughout normal work hours. For the sake of this project, it is assumed that work begins at 9 AM and ends at 5 PM. Users are also able to delete these tasks.
<br>
<br>
Users can expect to maintain their saved tasks upon reloading the page through use of local storage.
<br>
<br>
The application uses color coding to determine if a timeslot is in the past, present, or future. 
<br>
<br>

## Issues
STILL PLAYING CATCHUP...
<br>
This means missing functionality. I will continue to update and resubmit the application as soon as I am able.
